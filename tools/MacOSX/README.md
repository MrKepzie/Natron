# Natron on MacOSX

Scripts used to build and distribute [Natron](http://www.natron.fr) on MacOSX.


## Build server installation : basic setup

The first step is to install MacPorts. If you want to distribute an universal binary that runs on any OS X version >= 10.6, 

### Installing MacPorts on OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (universal)

* Download and install MacOSX Snow Leopard 10.6 retail DVD.

* Install Xcode 3.2.6 for Snow Leopard from developer.apple.com. Don't forget to also install the UNIX command-line utilities (this is an install option in Xcode 3).

* Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) 

* Add the following line to /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf:
```
-x11 +no_x11 +bash_completion +no_gnome +quartz +universal
```

### Installing MacPorts on OS X 10.7+ for deployment on OS X 10.6 (universal)

* Install the latest version of Xcode

* Download and install the missing OS X SDK, following instructions at https://github.com/devernay/xcodelegacy

* Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) 

* Add the following lines to `/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf`:
```
macosx_deployment_target 10.6
sdkroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk
```

* Add the following line to `/opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf`:
```
-x11 +no_x11 +bash_completion +no_gnome +quartz +universal
```

### Installing MacPorts on any version of OS X for deployment on the same OS X version

* Install the latest version of Xcode

* Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) 

* Add the following line to /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf:
```
-x11 +no_x11 +bash_completion +no_gnome +quartz
```

##  Installing required packages

* Download Macports [dports-dev](http://downloads.natron.fr/Third_Party_Sources/dports-dev.zip)

* Give read/execute permissions to the local repository:
```
chmod 755 /Users/USER_NAME/Development/dports-dev
```

* Check that the user "nobody" can read this directory by typing the following command in a Terminal: `sudo -u nobody ls /Users/USER_NAME/Development/dports-dev`. If it fails, then try again after having given execution permissions on your home directory using the following command: `chmod o+x /Users/USER_NAME`. If this still fails, then something is really wrong.

* Edit the sources.conf file for MacPorts, for example using the nano editor: `sudo nano /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf`, insert at the beginning of the file the configuration for a local repository (read the comments in the file), by inserting the line `file:///Users/USER_NAME/Development/dports-dev` (without quotes, and yes there are *three* - 3 - slashes). Save and exit (if you're using nano, this means typing ctrl-X, Y and return).

* Update MacPorts:
```
sudo port selfupdate
```

* Recreate the index in the local repository: (no need to be root for this)
```
cd /Users/USER_NAME/Development/dports-dev; portindex"
```

* Install clang-3.4:
```
sudo port install clang-3.4
sudo port select --set clang mp-clang-3.4 (so that clang and clang++ point to that version)
```

* Install gcc-4.8 and the Apple GCC driver:
```
sudo port install gcc48 +universal
git clone https://github.com/devernay/macportsGCCfixup.git
cd macportsGCCfixup
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

* Install the following packages:
```
sudo port install qt4-mac boost glew cairo expat jpeg openexr ffmpeg openjpeg15 freetype lcms ImageMagick lcms2 libraw opencolorio openimageio flex bison openexr seexpr fontconfig py27-shiboken py27-pyside
```

* `git clone https://github.com/MrKepzie/Natron`
 
* To build a snapshot:
```
cd Natron/tools/MacOSX
env MKJOBS=4 ./snapshot.sh
```

* To do a single build, modify TAGS in the begining of common.sh and then call the following:
```
cd Natron/tools/MacOSX
env CONFIG=relwithdebinfo BRANCH=tag  MKJOBS=4 UPLOAD=1 ./build.sh
```

The server will now auto build from the workshop branch on changes.

## Online repository

When building Natron you can upload it to a server (`UPLOAD=1`). For this to work you need to create a file named `local.sh` next to `snapshot.sh`, with for example the following content:
```
REPO_DEST=user@host:/path
REPO_URL=http://some.url
```

By default the snapshot.sh script will always upload hence you need to create the local.sh script to have snapshots working.
