// The Cache has several static configuration options:
//
// The persistent template parameter:
//
// Non-persistent cache (persistent=false):
// ---------------------
// The Cache only lives in RAM, it is never shared across processes.
// In this mode, all objects in the cache (classes deriving CacheEntryBase)
// are shared across threads within the process: When looking-up an entry with
// Cache::get, the entry might already exist, in which case it can be retrieved by calling
// CacheEntryLocker::getProcessLocalEntry (@see usage in EffectInstanceActions.cpp for example).
// It is very important that in this mode, that a derived class of CacheEntryBase is thread-safe itself.
// See for example ImageCacheEntry which implements a thread safe version when the cache is non persistent.
//
// This non persistent Cache is used for the general purpose Cache which stores results of actions (see EffectInstanceActions.cpp).
// Some actions store pointers provided by the plug-in which are local to the virtual memory of the process and may not be saved on disk.
// Heavy cache entries which take a long time to compute should be if possible stored in the persistent Cache because it will outlive the
// Natron process.
//
// Persistent cache (persistent=true):
// -----------------
//
// In this mode, all objects in the cache are not actually exposed to the CacheEntryBase:
// whenever reading an entry from the cache in the Cache::get function, internally a copy
// is made to the local CacheEntryBase object by using the CacheEntryBase::fromMemorySegment
// function which deserializes the virtual memory from the Cache.
// Similarly, when inserting the entry in the cache, it is copied using the CacheEntryBase::toMemorySegment
// In this mode, the CacheEntryBase in itself does not have to be thread-safe: the cache itself handles
// the thread-safety and ensures that the entry is created only once.
// Note that in this mode, the CacheEntryBase you pass to Cache::get is local to your call, nobody
// else knows about this object.
// Also in order to be persistent, all data structures passed in toMemorySegment/fromMemorySegment must be interprocess compliant
// (i.e: they must use allocators to the memory segment manager passed in parameter. See implementation examples in ImageCacheEntry.cpp)
//
// For now, there can only be a single persistent Cache in Natron, because only a single location can be provided by the user.
// The persistent Cache is the main Cache used to store images.

// Interprocess robust:
//  -------------------
// The following define can be set to enable cross-process robustness of the Cache.
// In this mode the cache can handle multiple processes accessing to the same cache concurrently, however
// the cache may not be placed in a network drive.
// If not defined, the cache supports only a single process with a persistent Cache,
// writing/reading from the cache concurrently, other processes will resort to a non persistent Cache instead.
// This mode enables a more complex thread/process-safety strategy because it must deal with abandonned mutex when a process
// is killed and cross-process access to the internal storage.

// Cache storage:
// -------------
// The storage in the Cache is split in 2 parts: the "table of contents" which holds for each entry most of the informations.
// For a persistent cache, data that is saved to the ToC is serialized/deserialized with the help of the CacheEntryBase::toMemorySegment and
// CacheEntryBase::fromMemorySegment function. The data is encoded as properties which maps a unique name to an array of a pod type (@see IPCPropertyMap).
// A non persistent Cache does not have to encode/decode such properties, it directly stores a shared pointer to the cache entry within the Cache:
// This adds the extra complexity to ensure that the CacheEntryBase derivative class is thread-safe in this mode.
//
// Image storage:
// -------------
// The Cache is mainly designed to efficiently store images within Natron.
// The requirements are:
// - Cache as much as possible images within the user-defined memory portion
// - Be persistent so that the Cache may be re-used between 2 runs of Natron
// - Be inter-process robust so that if multiple Natron processes run at the same time they can share images
// Since memory in the Cache is limited, the Cache itself has to be the manager of the memory used by images that are
// stored within the Cache.
// The memory in the Cache is actually stored in small memory chunks of NATRON_TILE_SIZE_BYTES bytes. For an image this represents a small tile
// of a mono-channel image.
// Since each tile has the same memory amount and the memory is aligned to a power of 2, efficient vector instructions can be used on them.
// The Cache exposes mainly the functionnality to allocate and free tiles. The assembling of tiles into images is itself managed by the ImageCacheEntry.
// Tiles in the Cache are pointers to virtual memory on a memory file.
// Tiles are referenced within the Cache by the TileInternalIndex structure which contains the index of the memory file containing the tile,
// and the tile index within this file. Both 32-bit indices are encoded in a single 64-bit index, @see getTileIndex function in the cpp.
// Note that all tile memory files have the same number of bytes.
//
// The retrieveAndLockTiles function is used to retrieve pointers to existing tiles (referenced by their TileInternalIndex) or to allocate new tiles.
// Since pointers to virtual memory are returned, the memory file itself is locked so that no Cache clearing can happen in the meantime.
// To notify the Cache when done with the memory pointers, the function unLockTiles will destroy any lock. The unLockTiles function
// can also make the tiles that were allocated in retrieveAndLockTiles be free again.
//
// Allocated tiles are always tied to a Cache entry, so that when the Cache entry is evicted from the Cache the memory associated is also released.
// However, you may explicitly remove memory allocated for a Cache entry using the releaseTiles function.
//
// Tiles memory storage:
// --------------------
// Internally within the Cache, a list stores the indices of tiles that are "free".
// Depending on the NATRON_CACHE_TILES_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_CENTRALIZED define,
// the internal memory management of the tiles can be either stored in a single "free tiles" list
// or in 256 sub-lists each stored in a different Cache bucket.
// When NATRON_CACHE_TILES_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_CENTRALIZED is defined, the list is protected by a single mutex, hence all threads
// are concurrently fighting to get access to this list.
// When NATRON_CACHE_TILES_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_CENTRALIZED is not defined, each bucket has its own mutex with its own sub-list.
// In this mode, the tricky part is to uniformly distribute tiles allocation across buckets so that we do not end-up with 1 bucket
// fully allocated while others are still empty: When a bucket is empty, we have no choice but to create a new memory file of NATRON_TILE_STORAGE_FILE_SIZE
// bytes to enable the bucket to get more free tiles. The distribution in this mode is crucial: in this mode each tile requested to allocate
// with the retrieveAndLockTiles function is associated with a TileHash 64-bit hash produced with the makeTileCacheIndex function.
// The first 2 hexadecimals digits of this hash determine into which bucket the tile must be allocated.
// This strategy adds some significant overhead to the main centralized strategy, mainly:
// - Each tile must have a good hash associated so that the distribution function is uniform
// - When allocating a lot of tiles at once (e.g: 1500, which regularly happens for a HD image), the thread calling retrieveAndLockTiles
// has to sequentially lock and unlock each bucket mutex that proctects the free tiles list. The thread could not take all 256 bucket mutexes
// otherwise we would be sure to end-up with a deadlock if multiple threads were to call this function at the same time, plus it would be just
// about the same as in the NATRON_CACHE_TILES_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_CENTRALIZED mode.
